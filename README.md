UzeboxMinimal
=============

Uzebox minimal design. The goal - to creat reprodusable modular design with minimal set of components.
Original project is located at http://uzebox.org

Update 13-Oct-2014: Added SD Card adapter.
eagle - To be opened with Eagle Cad 7.x.
schematics - Schematics, top jumpers and placement. Also an example of microSD adapter soldering. 
toner-transfer - Ready-to-print file for toner transfer. Have fun!
For best results:
Non-SDHC cards. In case using 2GB cards or bigger, create first partition about 256Mb. 
This is more, than enough for UzeBOX roms. 
Most important part partition should be FAT16 with 16K clusters.
